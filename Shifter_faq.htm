		<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b><i>9-01-2000 Release features</i></b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
        (<a href="#The following is a quick series of questions/answers  for Shifter server operators.&nbsp;">Scew
        the new stuff, take me to the Q&amp;A!!</a>)</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>New configuration options </b>:<br>
		These options are implemented in the serverConfig.cs /
        matchConfig.cs&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		<b>1) Tourney Chat Options </b>-<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
		<b>$Shifter::GlobalTChat = True;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // True - All players can chat global in Tourney Mode<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // False - Only players marked as Leader, Admin or SuperAdmin can chat.<br>
		<br>
		<b>2) New Admin options</b> -<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
		A) Clear Players TK Counts (For those super FUN indoor crazy matches where you know people can help but TK here and there.<br>
		B) Grant / Revoke No Ban - Allows admin to do just that... Only valid for the length of time a player is logged on to the server, this is NOT saved to a
        file.<br>
		C) Kill / Ban / Kick players now has a separate menu.<br>
		<br>
		<b>3)</b> <b>AutoAdmining</b> - Automatically placing players as Admin, SuperAdmin and NoBan has become very easy. The server admin now has the option to Admin or SuperAdmin players, each permitting different abilities. (see list):<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
		<b>Normal Admin Abilities :<br>
		</b>1) Change Players Team- Player Selected<br>
		2) Globally Mute/UnMute- Player Selected<br>
		3) Lock/Unlock Players Team- Player Selected<br>
		4) Set Mission Time Limit<br>
		5) Select Touney/FFA Mode<br>
		6) Change Mission<br>
		7) Cycle Mission<br>
		<br>
		<b>Super Admin Abilities :<br>
		</b>1) Kill,Ban or Kick Players- Player Selected<br>
		2) Clear Players TK Count- Player Selected<br>
		3) Grant/Revoke No Ban Status- Player Selected<br>
		4) Admin/DeAdmin Players- Player Selected<br>
		5) Give/Remove Penis Curse- Player Selected<br>
		6) Enable MATCH Mode<br>
		7) Reset Server To Defaults<br>
		<br>
		<b>Optional Super-Admin Abilities<br>
		</b>8) Locking Missile On/Off Toggle.<br>
		9) Turn On/Off Kill Counts For Turrets.<br>
        <br>
		This will allow server admins a greater range of control over the Admin - SuperAdmin - NoBanned - SAD features.<br>
		A sample block is given below:<br>
        //--------------------------------------------== 1 Turns ON AutoAdmin (If player has IP mask they will be autoadmined)<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;autoa&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Adds player to NOBan list<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;noban&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Ip mask for AutoAdmining check<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== (Left blank will NOT Autoadmin, MUST contain an IP mask to Autoadmin)<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;ipadr&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = &quot;IP:208.188.5&quot;;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Optional SAD password for user -<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Left blank user will NOT be able to use SAD<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== ability and will need to be auto-admined<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;sadpw&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = &quot;password&quot;;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Sets User to Normal Admin<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Sets User to BOTH Normal/SuperAdmin<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;super&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		Setting any of the numbered options from 1 to 0 will set that attribute to OFF<br>
		Super Admin will of course set players to both Normal and Super admin.<br>
		<br>
		So the block of info per player would look something like this.<br>
		<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;autoa&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 1;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;noban&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 0;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;ipadr&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = &quot;IP:208.188.5&quot;;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;sadpw&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = &quot;password&quot;;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 1;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;super&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 0;<br>
		<br>
		This player would be AutoAdmined at log on.<br>
		This player would also be able to use SAD(&quot;password&quot;); on the console if playing from a different machine.<br>
		This player would NOT be on the NO BAN list.<br>
		This player would ONLY be a normal Admin.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
        <b>
		4) No Swearing</b> - Will mute and eventually ban players for swearing.<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
        <b>
		$Shifter::noSwearing =
        True;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //True = On / False = Off<br>
        <b>
        <br>
        $Shifter::NoSwearing=&quot;True&quot;;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // == True means disallow swearing on your server? (update the SHBadwordlist.cs file)<br>
        <b>
        $Shifter::BadWordsMax=1;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // == If no swearing, This value is the limit at which the client starts being killed for swearing<br>
        <b>
        $Shifter::BadWordskick=2;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // == If no swearing, This value is the limit at which the client is kicked for swearing<br>
		<br>
		This function relies on a file in the /Tribes/Config directory called SHBadwordlist.cs<br>
		A sample file is included in the Shifter Zip file.<br>
		<br>
        <b>
		5) Missile Limits</b> - If ANY of these are set they will over ride the default settings for Missile limits.<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_EMP - EMP MissileDefault - 25<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_GAS - Poison MissileDefault - 25<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_PHE - Phoenix MissileDefault - 35<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_NAP - Napalm MissileDefault - 15<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_BOM - Havoc MissileDefault - 15<br>
		$Shifter::Missile_SPY - Spy PodsDefault - 100</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">example: <b> $Shifter::Missile_EMP=&quot;15&quot;;</b>
        would limit the EMP missiles to 15 per team.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">
        <b>
		6) Scoring Options</b>:&nbsp; These options allow you to turn On and Off Objective Scoring and Player Kill scoring<br>
		Using these options is NOT suggested, they are for DEBUG ONLY. If they are not included these will default<br>
		to ON/TRUE.<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
        <b>
		$Shifter::ObjScore = &quot;True&quot;;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // Allow Objects Being Destroyed To Award Bonus Points<br>
        <b>
		$Shifter::PlrScore = &quot;True&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // Allow Player Bonus Points To Be Awarded<br>
		<br>
		<br>
        <b>
		7) Public Notice</b> - If this is set to something besides NULL (&quot;&quot;), the message will be displayed every so often<br>
		after a player spawns.<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
        <b>
		$Shifter::PublicNotice = &quot;This server is in testing mode. If things are odd, please dont complain.&quot;;<br>
        </b>
		<br>
        <b>
		8) Other New Options</b><br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
        <b>
		$Shifter::TwoMinute = &quot;True&quot;;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // == Two Minute Warning Notice On/Off (Default = True)<br>
        <b>$Shifter::LooseScore = 0.75;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        // == This is the score ratio for the loosing team. 0.5 for instance would cut a loosing players score by 1/4.<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
        <br>
        <b>Miscellaneous bug fixes:<br>
        </b>1) Fixed - GodHammer Bug/Exploit.<br>
        2) Fixed - Observers getting placed on team when teams are juggled.<br>
        3) Fixed - Players spawning in the wrong base when teams are juggled.<br>
        4) Missile Station limits and other wise... We have made the Missile Station NON-Deployable on Air-Bases... Emplacements are still ok, just NOT on an AirBase. Unseen Missile
        Jockeys who have ABSOLUTELY NO RISK involved in missile firing are REALLY annoying.<br>
	Also the ASTRONOMICAL points that you gain for missile kills will be removed... More normal points will be gained. Its not like it takes any real effort to plow over something with a missile. Point values are now a little more like the normal way of killing things... I really
        don't want to here any complaints about this because the scoring system was not originally designed with the Guided Missiles in mind, and the absurd scores where certainly not intended to happen the way they have been... Sorry, no more 1000+ points games for some one who sits in the same place for the whole mission.<br>
        5) Missile trails functions correctly now, (again)...<br>
        6) Flyer trails have been tweaked a good deal and look very nice and realistic...<br>
        7) Added Chase Cam options for observer modes... Allows you to follow the player including keeping the players facing at all times. This certainly will add to a ref's ability to moderate games and keep an eye on the players.<br>
        8) Plasma Gun tweaked...&nbsp;<br>
        8a) Multi-Fire has been tweaked to provide a perfectly even spread, no more condensed spreads some times and complete spreads the other times. The pattern is perfectly
        consistent no matter what the facing of the player.<br>
        8b) The normal mode has gotten a new image and been supped up as far as speed and power go.<br>
        8c) The Multi-Fire mode uses 2 Ammo now instead of the standard 1.<br>
        8d) Rapid-Fire has increased in power and speed.<br>
        9) Flyers have received a new effect.&nbsp; When flyers become damaged they now smoke... Twin smoke trains will let the enemy know that the flyer that is
        approaching is damaged. Flyers that receive more damage will also catch on fire, this does NOT add more damage to the flyer but produces a large burning trail that follows the flyer. (Trails will be made server configurable, so that server admins can turn them on and off).<br>
        10) Flame Thrower has gotten a new effect as well, looks MUCH more like a flamer.<br>
        11) Added BoomStick death messages that actually work.<br>
        12) Fixed a particularly nasty bug in the Telepad... (Thanks for the info
        Quik!)<br>
        13) Fixed up a slight cheat with the deployable Generator<br>
        14) Arbitor device bug fixed.&nbsp;<br>
        15) Nuke explosion tweaked a little.<br>
        16) The Interceptor PACK has been limited. If you are interested in using interceptors after the pack limit has been used, It
        is suggested you keep your flyer pad working.<br>
        17) Small bug with one of the flyers was also fixed up.<br>
        18) The deployable sensor jammer has now been limited to the Engineer, Chem and Merc. The Sensor Jammer will now, within the radius of a Missile Jammer, completely nullify the effects of the missile jammer beacon.<br>
        19) Missle Jammer beacon for Engineer is now gone. We have added a new Beacon, like the EMP or Shield beacon that will jam missiles at up to 75m. There is a new "dead" missile effect also which looks really nice.<br>
        20) Engineer energy has been supped up a little to help in deployment of
        defense and offense.<br>
        21) AirBases and Emplacements are now completely destroyable ONLY by Nuke damaging weapons<br>
        22) Fixed up the Regen-pack bug for the Arbitor<br>
        23) Added WireGuided missiles<br>
        24) Enabled the 1.11 code to defeat cheats such as HappyMod, autobeacons
        etc..<br>
        25) New observer Mode options added<br>
        26) Floating mortar bug fixed, along with more miscellaneous fixes and
        tweaks...</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Pre 9-01-2000 information (still important though)...</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">For those who have ran Shifter in the past, there are some new rules that apply.</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The latest release adds support for a serverside language filter. To use this, place the SHBadwordlist.cs file in your config directory and update these new variables in your config files:<br>
			<b>$Shifter::NoSwearing=&quot;True&quot;;</b> // == True means disallow swearing on your server? (update the SHBadwordlist.cs file)<br>
			<b>$Shifter::BadWordsMax=3;</b> // == If no swearing, This value is the limit at which the client starts being killed for swearing<br>
			<b>$Shifter::BadWordskick=6;</b> // == If no swearing, This value is the limit at which the client is kicked for swearing<br>
			<br>
			Those who do not want this feature simple leave the NoSwearing variable set to false.<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The new code allows for only 2 configuration files on the server... The first (<i><b>serverConfig.cs</b></i>) is the default server configuration you always run, and the second (<i><b>matchConfig.cs</b></i>) is what you wish the server to be configured to when the match option is selected. The easiest way to make these files is to create the serverConfig.cs file, then make a copy of it, rename the copy to matchConfig.cs and then change the appropriate variables in the match file. Any variables used should have a 'duplicate' or corresponding value in the opposite configuration file. So if you $Server::Password=&quot;password&quot;; in your matchConfig file, you should have a corresponding $Server::Password=&quot;&quot;; in your serverConfig.cs (to remove the password).<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There no longer a shifter_v1.cs file. You should copy all your variables from the shifter_v1.cs (and serverPrefs.cs) file and paste them into your serverConfig.cs file. Then <b>DELETE</b> or <b>RENAME</b> the shifter_v1.cs (and serverPrefs.cs) file. This is MOST IMPORTANT! the way the new code keeps track of variables has changed, and the appropriate configuration file is executed when you select match or default from the new admin TAB menus<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There are a few new variables as well:<br>
			<b>$Shifter::Tag0=&quot;|00|&quot;;</b> // Tribe 'tag' for autoassign team 1<br>
			<b>$Shifter::Tag1=&quot;|XX|&quot;;</b> // Tribe 'tag' for autoassign team 2<br>
			<br>
			This works as follows... If the server is set to Tournament mode (put in your matchConfig.cs file $Server::TourneyMode = &quot;True&quot;;) the server will automatically assign players to each team according to the tag id you assign... so this means if you're playing tribes *EMO* against :|SPC|: then set the config file to be - $Shifter::Tag0=&quot;*EMO*&quot;; and $Shifter::Tag1=&quot;:|SPC|:&quot;; -<br>
			<br>
			The server checks players at mission cycle and connect for the tag and auto assigns the team, if the tag does not exist, they are put in observer mode and the Admin must assign their team. (in the above example, player :|SPC|: MrHankey would be assigned to team2... (note: the tag can be anywhere in the name)<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There are new options in the TAB menu, allowing tourney mode (using current configuration), match configuration (executing the matchConfig.cs file - recommended over default tourney mode-), and reset to defaults (puts the server back to the default configuration set in the serverConfig.cs)<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The requested option for Vote and Admin menu change options to include to MORE MISSION TYPES option has been added.<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">Several bug fixes and tweaks, including Godhammer, AA Turrets, DetBug crash, Elf Turret, restructured Vote menu, Tournament mode support, etc.<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>NB</b> - Whenever you update any code or variables on the server, <b>delete</b> the contents of your tribes\temp directory. This simple precaution solves many unforseen headaches.</font>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The way it works is like this...<br>
		<br>
		The in-game admin prepares to start the match, so they select the 'Enable match configuration' option from the TAB menu. The server executes the matchConfig.cs file and saves the new configuration to the temp directory. each mission cycle from here on reloads the stored data from the temp dir to maintain the match configuration. (the reason why we deleted the shifter_v1.cs file, to prevent overwriting the data at mission cycle)<br>
		When the server starts in tourney mode, teams are assigned by the tags set in the configuration file (matchConfig.cs) and any non matching players are set to observer for manual assignment.<br>
		<br>
		When the match is finished, the admin then selects the option 'reset to server defaults' from the TAB menu, and the default serverConfig.cs file is executed and stored in the temp data directory.<br>
		<br>
		This update should allow matches to be run without server admin intervention, and in a ladder situation, one default matchConfig.cs file can be created and distributed to all match servers to provide a contiguous and level playing field.<br>

		<p><a name="Q: What is the difference between a dedicated server and a listen server?"></a><font size="3" face="Arial">A:</font> <font size="3" face="Arial">A dedicated server is a server which uses the -dedicated commandline switch, and runs the game in a <i>dedicated </i>fashion. You are unable to play locally on a server of this type, but must connect to it from an additional PC. This is the preferred method of running a server. A <i>listen</i> server is one in which you host a game and play at the same time, on the same PC. Any users attempting to connect to this type of game will be at a severe disadvantage, and most likely experience severe lag.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><a name="Q: What happened to the shifter_v1.cs file?"></a>A: In the latest build additional functionality for tournaments and clan matches was added. As a result the MOD has been restructured. The need for one configuration file is required to prevent server variables from being overwritten. If you previously used multiple configuration files, you will now be required to consolidate them into one, entitled ServerConfig.cs.</font></p>
		<p>
		<hr>
		<p><a href="#Q: How do I make the teams be assigned automatically in tournament or match mode?"><font size="3" face="Arial">Q: How do I make the teams be assigned automatically in tournament or match mode?</font></a></p>
		<p><font size="3"><a name="Q: How do I make the teams be assigned automatically in tournament or match mode?"></a></font><font face="Arial" size="3">A: </font><font face="Arial" size="3">To assign someone to a team, two new server variables have been introduced: <i><b>$Shifter::Tag0=&quot;|00|&quot;; ,$Shifter::Tag1=&quot;|XX|&quot;; </b></i>Simply place these tags in your matchConfig.cs file and change the values of the string (the stuff in the quotes) to the tag used by the clan/tribe to be assigned to that team.&nbsp;<br>
		</font><font size="3">For instance: Tribe1 tag used is |BoF|... so </font><font face="Arial" size="3"><i><b>$Shifter::Tag0=&quot;|BoF|&quot;; </b></i>would place them automatically on team0 when the server is in match or tourney mode. The tag can be matched anywhere in the players handle. |BoF|Leader, player|BoF|, i.Am|BoF|like are all valid matches.</font></p>
		<p>

		<p><a href="#Q How do I use the new Match or Tournament features?"><font size="3" face="Arial">Q How do I use the new Match or Tournament features?</font></a></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><a name="Q How do I use the new Match or Tournament features?"></a>A: Here's the skinny:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">The new code allows for only 2 configuration files on the server... The first (<i><b>serverConfig.cs</b></i>) is the default server configuration you always run, and the second (<i><b>matchConfig.cs</b></i>) is what you wish the server to be configured to when the match option is selected. The easiest way to make these files is to create the serverConfig.cs file, then make a copy of it, rename the copy to matchConfig.cs and then change the appropriate variables in the match file. Any variables used should have a 'duplicate' or corresponding value in the opposite configuration file. So if you $Server::Password=&quot;password&quot;; in your matchConfig file, you should have a corresponding $Server::Password=&quot;&quot;; in your serverConfig.cs (to remove the password).<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There no longer a shifter_v1.cs file. You should copy all your variables from the shifter_v1.cs file and paste them into your serverConfig.cs file. Then <b>DELETE</b> or <b>RENAME</b> the shifter_v1.cs file. This is MOST IMPORTANT! the way the new code keeps track of variables has changed, and the appropriate configuration file is executed when you select match or default from the new admin TAB menus<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There are a few new variables as well:<br>
			<b>$Shifter::Tag0=&quot;|00|&quot;;</b> // Tribe 'tag' for autoassign team 1<br>
			<b>$Shifter::Tag1=&quot;|XX|&quot;;</b> // Tribe 'tag' for autoassign team 2<br>
			<br>
			This works as follows... If the server is set to Tournament mode (put in your matchConfig.cs file $Server::TourneyMode = &quot;True&quot;;) the server will automatically assign players to each team according to the tag id you assign... so this means if you're playing tribes *EMO* against :|SPC|: then set the config file to be - $Shifter::Tag0=&quot;*EMO*&quot;; and $Shifter::Tag1=&quot;:|SPC|:&quot;; -<br>
			<br>
			The server checks players at mission cycle and connect for the tag and auto assigns the team, if the tag does not exist, they are put in observer mode and the Admin must assign their team. (in the above example, player :|SPC|: MrHankey would be assigned to team2... (note: the tag can be anywhere in the name)<br>
			</font>
			<li><font size="3" face="Arial">There are new options in the TAB menu, allowing tourney mode (using current configuration), match configuration (executing the matchConfig.cs file - recommended over default tourney mode-), and reset to defaults (puts the server back to the default configuration set in the serverConfig.cs)<br>
			</font>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The way it works is like this...<br>
		<br>
		The in-game admin prepares to start the match, so they select the 'Enable match configuration' option from the TAB menu. The server executes the matchConfig.cs file and saves the new configuration to the temp directory. each mission cycle from here on reloads the stored data from the temp dir to maintain the match configuration. (the reason why we deleted the shifter_v1.cs file, to prevent overwriting the data at mission cycle)<br>
		When the server starts in tourney mode, teams are assigned by the tags set in the configuration file (matchConfig.cs) and any non matching players are set to observer for manual assignment.<br>
		<br>
		When the match is finished, the admin then selects the option 'reset to server defaults' from the TAB menu, and the default serverConfig.cs file is executed and stored in the temp data directory.<br>
		<br>
		This update should allow matches to be run without server admin intervention, and in a ladder situation, one default matchConfig.cs file can be created and distributed to all match servers to provide a contiguous and level playing field.<br>

If so, have a buddy update his list... sometimes the master lists just take time to update. Worst case scenario, you and your friends can manually add it to your browser with this <a href="#Q: I can't see a server in the browser list... is there a way I can add it manually?">command</a>.</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Arial">
		<b>A: </b> AutoAdmining - Automatically placing players as Admin, SuperAdmin and NoBan has become very easy. The server admin now has the option to Admin or SuperAdmin players, each permitting different abilities. (see list):<br>
		==================================================================================================<br>
		<b>Normal Admin Abilities :<br>
		</b>1) Change Players Team- Player Selected<br>
		2) Globally Mute/UnMute- Player Selected<br>
		3) Lock/Unlock Players Team- Player Selected<br>
		4) Set Mission Time Limit<br>
		5) Select Touney/FFA Mode<br>
		6) Change Mission<br>
		7) Cycle Mission<br>
		<br>
		<b>Super Admin Abilities :<br>
		</b>1) Kill,Ban or Kick Players- Player Selected<br>
		2) Clear Players TK Count- Player Selected<br>
		3) Grant/Revoke No Ban Status- Player Selected<br>
		4) Admin/DeAdmin Players- Player Selected<br>
		5) Give/Remove Penis Curse- Player Selected<br>
		6) Enable MATCH Mode<br>
		7) Reset Server To Defaults<br>
		<br>
		<b>Optional Super-Admin Abilities<br>
		</b>8) Locking Missile On/Off Toggle.<br>
		9) Turn On/Off Kill Counts For Turrets.<br>
        <br>
		This will allow server admins a greater range of control over the Admin - SuperAdmin - NoBanned - SAD features.<br>
		A sample block is given below:<br>
        //--------------------------------------------== 1 Turns ON AutoAdmin (If player has IP mask they will be autoadmined)<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;autoa&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Adds player to NOBan list<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;noban&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Ip mask for AutoAdmining check<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== (Left blank will NOT Autoadmin, MUST contain an IP mask to Autoadmin)<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;ipadr&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = &quot;IP:208.188.5&quot;;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Optional SAD password for user -<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== Left blank user will NOT be able to use SAD<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== ability and will need to be auto-admined<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;sadpw&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = &quot;password&quot;;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Sets User to Normal Admin<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		//--------------------------------------------== 1 Sets User to BOTH Normal/SuperAdmin<br>
        <b>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;super&quot;, &quot;Emo1313&quot;] = 1;</b><br>
		<br>
		Setting any of the numbered options from 1 to 0 will set that attribute to OFF<br>
		Super Admin will of course set players to both Normal and Super admin.<br>
		<br>
		So the block of info per player would look something like this.<br>
		<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;autoa&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 1;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;noban&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 0;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;ipadr&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = &quot;IP:208.188.5&quot;;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;sadpw&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = &quot;password&quot;;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;admin&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 1;<br>
		$Server::Admin[&quot;super&quot;, &quot;Dastardly&quot;] = 0;<br>
		<br>
		This player would be AutoAdmined at log on.<br>
		This player would also be able to use SAD(&quot;password&quot;); on the console if playing from a different machine.<br>
		This player would NOT be on the NO BAN list.<br>
		This player would ONLY be a normal Admin.</font></p>

        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A: The latest build uses the 1.11 code
        functionality to defeat certain cheats some people were using. As a
        result, the server will validate the clients' model and skins for the
        following items: </font><font size="3" face="Arial">mines, beacons,
        sniper rifle, armors, turrets, camera, flags, and remote inv/ammo
        stations. Here's a quick blurb on the situation:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i><b>Try connecting to a 1.11 base
          server, and you'll find that you do have modified files on your
          system. The new code (updated, server ops should check the forum)
          validates the model and skins of the following items: mines, beacons,
          sniper rifle, armors, turrets, camera, flags, and remote inv/ammo
          stations. If you connect and get dropped from the server, you are
          running a modified version of one of these items... you just may not
          realize it. The server will inform you of the offending item after you
          have been dropped. Just because you don't have any scripts installed
          does not mean you may be affected. Early (pre 1.11) skinvols may have
          included custom skins for the sniper rifle or inventory stations. The glamour
          pack is a prime example of this. Granted the glamour pack is not a
          cheat, but it did include custom skins for the remote inventory items
          which will not work with 1.11. As a side note, the pack has been
          updated to operate under 1.11, but some items were removed. The
          kicking of the players is not a shifter issue, it is a result of the
          1.11 validation checks. Again, I stress... Try a base 1.11 server and
          the same thing will happen. The solution? Remove the offending *.dts
          or skinfiles from your system. It's your call... do you want to run a
          mod that will support the cheat scripts or not? For those who don't
          believe they exist, I managed to get a copy and took some screenshots
          with the checks disabled to show you just how unfair they are. You can
          see them from this <a href="http://members.home.com/fubarascain/cheats/">LINK.</a>
          Several people have reported the same problem, and the solution has
          been the same for all of them. The removal of the offending items
          allowed them to connect. (An amendment: Apparently MrPoops Skinchooser
          scripts come with some offending 1.11 skins as well... check for gp*.avl.vol
          files and remove them)</b></i></font></p>
