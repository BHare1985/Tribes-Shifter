http://www.tribeshifter.com/k/
Created by: KiLL(-) & enV.3zer0
   ShifterK is a MOD for the Starsiege TRIBES. It is based on another popular MOD called renegades. The MOD started back 1999 when a programmer by the name of Emo1313.
   Then in 2002, a young and very bright modder played the mod and decided the make his own set of changes. His mod was called Shifter_V1G. He modified Shifter to the max, making it a better MOD for all, after a year or so he decided to move on to other things.
   Finally in 2003, KiLL(-) decided to make some changes and fix some problems of the left off mod. After a little while a interested gamer, enV.3zer0. He  decided to help out KiLL(-) and that become the first official team of Shifter. KiLL(-) felt that ShifterK was safe in the hands of his new partner and decided to help out Tribes 2 Shifter. 
   Today enV.3zer0 is the current modder of Shifter and is currently helping out yet another programmer to join the history of Shifter.
