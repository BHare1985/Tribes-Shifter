Some words from the author.
---
The entire reason that this document and notice have been created, is to keep the concepts, ideas and functionality intended by the author, intact. As well as keeping these concepts and ideas in parallel with the Tribes modification known as Shifter.

There are several Tribes mods out that are based in part on Shifter code, or that include some Shifter originating code in them. I do NOT discourge the use of my code, infact I encourage people to take apart the code and look at it... The code is in my opinion, very well laid out and very well commented.

Any one interested in Shifter or other mod and mod writting are more than welcome to take a look at the code that I have worked on since April 1999.

The Shifter code contains functions that were also contributed from other mods, a full listing of aknowledgements is available on the Shifter web site at www.dopplegangers.com/tribes/shifter ... We do not take thier code and claim it to be ours, however so much of this code has been altered to make Shifter what it is as far as playability, balance, and functionality are concerned.

If you are interested in seeing certain modification to be added to Shifter for what ever purposes and would like to inquire about these modification being added as a feature or option in future releases of Shifter, please do not hesitate to send your suggestions to the Author, emo1313@dopplegangers.com
