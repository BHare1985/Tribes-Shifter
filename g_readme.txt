For Dedicated Servers
--------------------------------
Just unzip using folder names into the tribes directory
double click "StartShifter.bat"


For Un-Dedicated servers
--------------------------------
Make a shortcut to your tribes.exe
Right click to open properties of the shortcut
In the box where it says Target, add this to the end of the line:
" -mod Shifter_v1G +exec serverconfig"
(without the "")

If you have no serverconfig.cs
or your weapon options are not showing up.
After you have installed, open g_serverconfig.cs in your config folder
rename it to serverconfig.cs

Make sure to go through and edit.  Especially the server name.
